# Assignment1_SSD_Lab

#this is the first assignment for software design with python course. It contain five scripts: task1, task2, task3, task4 and main script

##main.py: to run the four tasks you need to enter Integer number from 1 to 4 such that 1 to run task1.py, 2 to run task2.py, 3 to run task3.py, and  4 to run task4.py and if you enter another character and the program will be terminated.
main file contains functions quadratic equation solver function, pascal triangle printer, fact,...

##task1.py: contains the implementation of function decorator that calculates function execution time and the number of times the decorated function was called (function call trace). it works for multiple functions.

##task2.py: contains the implementation of function decorator To inspect and manipulate function objects.

##task3.py: contains the implementation of class decorator such that the class decorator output could be dumped into trial.txt file. And Rank the all decorated functions to plot a rankings table.

##task4.py: contains the implementation of function decorator such that if a decorated function encounters an error it wouldnâ€™t put it back into stdout. Instead, pipe the error stream into a log file together with a timestamp.
